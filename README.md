# Mess Organizer

Organize your desktop, downloads and other messy folders with a simple rake command. Easy and effective.

## Usage

You will need [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/installation/) and [Rake](https://rubygems.org/gems/rake) installed on your OS before you start using the Mess Organizer. If you have the Rake gem already installed, just clone this repo to the folder you want to organize and run "rake". 

In the following example, let's organize a typical messy download folder:

```
$ cd ~/Downloads
$ git clone https://github.com/tiagopog/mess_organizer.git
$ rake --rakefile mess_organizer/Rakefile
```

1. The "Downloads" folder before organizing it:

2. Running the "rake" command. Note that it displays where each file/folder is being placed:

3. Done! Now you have a brand new organized folder with your files under the "stuff":
